# Obstacle Avoiding Two-Wheeler Robot using Arduino

## Description
An autonomous two-wheeler robot that detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.
The robot uses Arduino Uno, DC motors, and an L298N motor driver for movement control.
An SG90 servo motor enables multi-directional obstacle scanning.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- SG90 Servo Motor
- Battery and Chassis

## Working Principle
- The Ultrasonic Sensor detects obstacles.
- Arduino processes the sensor data.
- If an obstacle is detected,the robot stops and turns.
-The L298N motor driver controls motor movements

## Features
- Real-time obstacle detection
- Automatic direction change
- Servo-based environmental scanning
- Autonomous navigation

## Applications
- Robotics and automation
- Autonomous vehicles
- Smart mobility systems
